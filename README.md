# Gradation Challenge
An event lead has come in on your dashboard and you want to give the row a background color to indicate the status. If the current time is within 6 hours of the event the color is transitioned between a teal & yellow. After 6 hours the color is between yellow & red. After 48 hours the color remains at red.

## Goal
The goal of this is to compare solutions & how a complex algorithm can be modeled & accomplished along with discovering new approaches, languages, and patterns.

## Progress
Below are three samples of code to accomplish that:
- [X] Vanilla ES6 JS
- [X] Functional Reactive Programming - Accomplished with Highland
- [X] Functional Reactive Programming - Accomplished with RxJS
- [ ] Transducers - Clojure inspired function composition with transducers-js
- [ ] Combining highland with transducer - Highland has support for it sooo why not?
- [ ] ClojureScript - why not
- [ ] LispyScript - again, why not
